# Multimodal Ground-based cloud Database (MGCD)
The TJNU multimodal ground-based cloud database (MGCD) is collected in Tianjin, China from 2017 to 2018. It contains 8217 multimodal ground-based samples which are divided into seven sky types: 1) cumulus, 2) altocumulus and cirrocumulus, 3) cirrus and cirrostratus, 4) clear sky, 5) stratocumulus, stratus and altostratus, 6) cumulonimbus and nimbostratus, 7) mixed cloudness. In the MGCD, each sky type includes 2037, 604, 717, 652, 2086, 1353 and 768 samples respectively, and each sample comprises one ground-based cloud image and a set of multimodal cloud information which are one-to-one correspondence. The cloud images are captured by a sky camera with fisheye lens and stored in JPEG format with the pixel resolution of 1024Ã—1024. The multimodal cloud information collected by a weather station includes temperature, humidity, pressure and wind speed, and is stored in a vector with four elements. All the samples are cooperatively annotated by the meteorologist and the ground-based cloud researchers. The MGCD will be provided free of charge to cloud-related researchers in order to promote research. This agreement is granted by the providers in College of Electronic and Communication Engineering, Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, China, and Meteorological Observation Centre, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing, China.
